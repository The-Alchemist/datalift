This is the client part for the rdftransform module. It is compiled using GWT, and contains only a client
part (no server) that sends JSON calls to the rdftransform-server part.

*** This module requires Maven. You need to have Maven installed to compile it. (The build.xml simply redirects to maven calls.) ***

You DON'T need to install GWT to compile the module. The maven plugin will take care of downloading GWT for you.
