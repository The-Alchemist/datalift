IMPLEMENTATION GENERAL ISSUE

*gsp in fuseki managed as sparql endpt (change uri and change op). in others?
*consider how to check settings in config file properly set (all param needed available)
	->eg namedGraphUri set
	->eg one of sparql,ldp gsp interface set
*consider what can be checked at service start up and what later
 so to avoid problems at run time (eg if there is no policy graph!) 
	-> eg interface uri initialization at start-up? (eg in fuseki part yes anfd part no)
	-> eg that namedGraphUri set correspond to an existing graph?

FLINT 

hacked to remove useless part (commented) and changed id of DOM element (in a wayy that depend on flint div container)
so that is possible have more flint editors on same page. hacked also docs.css since based on selectors (make it based on class)
and commented useless part.

REQUIRE JS AND BACKBONE BOOTSTRAPPING

now fire an ajax call since complicated trick to have data bootstrapped with the page when using require js
in particular may be useful have the list of policies bootstrapped since to be show at the beginning
(at least 1st page, whole collection may not be feasible!)

I18N
use a /languages route that generate template for backbone in the proper language (exploiting app.render() of express).
It also update config file (ie update settings obj) with the language set.
So template generated only when language changed.


BOOTSTRAP 
may be dowloaded again customized to fit proj needs and to customize something (eg background colors etc)
now GUI has no no responsive pages (only fluid design)

compatibility prob between <pre> bootstrap style and codemirror (cursor doesn't go to EOL) -> hacked bootstrap css (commented pre style problematic statement)

SPARQL.CSS (FLINTEDITOR) hacked
removed cursor text on whole document (html{cursor:text;}) and set only on codemirror div (.CodeMirror{cursor:text;})

DATEPICKER hacked 
css (problem in z-index with bootstrap modal)

JQUERY UI BOOTSTRAP 
hacked css (problem in z-index with bootstrap modal)

JQUERY UI ADDRESSPICKER 
1) added updateMap() function to solve problem of the map not centered in a modal 
2) changed reverseCode at true by default to update lat and lon with marker position changes
(1/07)
3) added functions to manage radius, and modified address picker object (added a prop to refer to distance widget obj)

BOOTSTRAP JQUERY UI hacked (addedd tooltip from bootstrap)

FILTER IN ASK QUERY 
prob { FILTER(?v ...) } not allowed according to sparql semantic: there must be 
at least a triple with ?v inside brackets, ie { ...?v... FILTER(?v ...) }

solution used at now:
//the triple "?consumer rdf:type foaf:Person." reapeted both inside than outside
//UNION branch if there is a union or 2 times in case of no union.

//ie possible query generated are like
//ask{?consumer a foaf:Person. ?consumer a foaf:Person. FILTER(?consumer = <http://ex.org/a>) ...}
//or
//ask{
//{?consumer a foaf:Person. ?consumer a foaf:Person. FILTER(?consumer = <http://ex.org/a>)}
//UNION
//{...}
//}
//ask query like those TESTED WITH FUSEKI ONLY and they works

in add if more is and isNot used in and generate something like that still not so clear solution
{ ...  
?consumer rdf:type foaf:Person.
FILTER ((?consumer = <x> ))
?consumer rdf:type foaf:Person.
FILTER ()
...}
ALLOWED by sparql grammar, from pt of view of sparql semantic they are in and (ie equivalent to FILTER ( (?consumer = <x> ) && (!(?consumer = <k> )) ) )

POSSIBLE OPTIMIZATIONS
- use a instead of rdf:type is shorter and not require rdf prefix (at least with fuseki)
